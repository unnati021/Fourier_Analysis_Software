# Fourier_Analysis_Software
In this project we use python to build a FFT analysis software.
The software was built using TKinter and was maade mathematically comaptible using these libraries: matplotlib, scipy, numpy, math, etc. The software is used for Fourier Analysis.
The software is compatible with multiple input waveforms which can undergo mathematical manipulation to produce a single waveform to be used as input.
Windowing functions were also added to the software to improve the output results .
